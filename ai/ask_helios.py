        "At the $100 contract, that's $22.50. At $5,000, that's $1,125. Per member.\n\n"
        "2. THE SMART CONTRACT ENGINE — 45% of every activation in your "
        "connection mesh goes into a pool. That pool distributes across the full "
        "depth using a published formula. Depth 1 gets 50%, Depth 2 gets 25%, "
        "Depth 3 gets 12.5%, and so on. You receive allocations from members you never "
        "even met — because your connections connected them.\n\n"
        "3. GOLD, NFTs, AND CRYPTO — part of every activation buys "
        "physical gold. You get gold-backed NFT certificates. You can "
        "convert to BTC, ETH, XRP, stablecoins, or hold physical metal. "
        "Plus Staking rewards from 5% to 30%.\n\n"
        "No ranks. No quotas. No monthly. Just these three channels."

    # ─── Direct Connections ───────────────────────────────────────

    "direct_referral": (
        "The direct connection allocation is the simplest channel. You connect a member, "
        "you receive an allocation. That day.\n\n"

    "smart_contract_engine": (
        "The smart contract engine is where the real scale lives.\n\n"

        "The dollar amounts per member get smaller at deeper hops. "

        "Small per member × substantial volume = real allocations. That's the engine."
    ),

    "allocation_formula": (
        "The allocation formula is published and deterministic. Nobody decides "
        "who gets what — the math does.\n\n"
        "W_h = W_1 · r^(h-1)\n\n"
        "That means each depth gets half the weight of the depth above it. "
        "Depth 1 = 50%. Depth 2 = 25%. Depth 3 = 12.5%. And so on.\n\n"
        "The pool is 45% of the activation fee:\n"

    # ─── Smart Contract Propagation ───────────────────────────────

    "propagation": (
        "Think of smart contract propagation like signal flowing through a mesh.\n\n"
        "When someone activates a contract, the smart contract distributes "
        "allocations outward through the connection graph. Each hop reduces "
        "the allocation by a decay factor.\n\n"
        "Depth 1 gets 50%. Depth 2 gets 25%. Depth 3 gets 12.5%. And so on.\n\n"
        "The person who made the direct connection receives the largest allocation. "
        "Members further up the chain receive progressively smaller amounts — "
        "but they receive from every activation in their mesh, not just "
        "direct connections.\n\n"

        "The formula is deterministic — W_h = W_1 · r^(h-1). "
        "No discretion. Pure math.\n\n"

    "growth_scenario": (
        "Let me show you the math at scale.\n\n"
        "Direct connectors — closest to new activations — receive the "
        "largest allocations per member. Members further upstream receive "
        "smaller per-member amounts but from more total activations.\n\n"
        "With a growing mesh on the $100 contract:\n"
        "Direct connection allocations: $22.50 per member.\n"
        "Depth 2 allocations: $11.25 per member.\n"
        "Depth 3 allocations: $5.625 per member.\n\n"
        "As the mesh grows, volume compounds. The per-member amount "
        "decreases with depth, but the number of members increases "
        "exponentially.\n\n"
        "With higher contracts ($500, $1,000, $5,000), these numbers "
        "scale proportionally. The formula doesn't change. "
        "The structure doesn't change. Just bigger numbers.\n\n"
        "These are mathematical projections based on the formula. "
